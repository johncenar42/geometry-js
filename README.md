Geometry Dash

One of my favorite games of all time, this game is amazing. it has one problem though...... I CANT PLAY IT DURING SCHOOL TwT

therefore the only logical conclusion is to remake it in VANILLA JS

(vanilla js is so fluffing stupid ngl)



it looks like schoology b/c my school was blocking it -_-




ya


also this is developed by h-iscool
https://github.com/h-iscool

um

ya this repo is gonna be moved a lot

ALSO, this WILL be COMPLETLY rewriten as the code at this time sucks and i am wanting to make a game engine in js

also also im probably going to migrate away from using h-iscool or variations of that name as i made it like 8 years ago...........


NOTE: this project ,if viewed close to release, will be complete dogwater - i am speedrunning for "intro to cs" final (ive been coding for about 6y at this point and this is rly easy so i wanted to do this)
